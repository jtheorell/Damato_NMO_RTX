# Damato_NMO_RTX
This repository is linked to the paper "Rituximab abrogates aquaporin-4-specific germinal centre activity in patients with Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders" by Valentina Damato et al that will arrive shortly in PNAS. 
Here, the analysis files, the data sheet for the flow cytometry part of the projects are stored. For the raw flow cytometry data, the user is kindly referred to: http://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-Z5E3. The metadata sheet for the raw data is also present in this dataset, and called "Metadata_for_samples_on_flow_repository.csv". 

NB! All the pairs of flow cytometry files have been acquired separately, so gating and conmpensation is done on a per-sample basis.
